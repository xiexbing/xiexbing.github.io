I am an HPC systems engineer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I conduct system research and emphasize on several areas: distributed systems, operating systems, file systems and high performance computing. Recently, I apply machine learning techniques for I/O performance prediction on production supercomputers, for elastic resource management on IaaS cloud, and for data placement on hierarchical memory systems.
