I am a Senior Researcher at [the DeepSpeed team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/deepspeed/) at Microsoft AI. I conduct computer systems research emphasizing on file systems, deep learning systems, and resource scheduling and management in HPC and cloud. 

Before joining Microsoft, I was a research scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (2017-2022). During my time at ORNL, I received the 2021 [IEEE-CS TCHPC Early Career Researchers Award for Excellence in High Performance Computing](https://tc.computer.org/tchpc/2021/09/23/2021-ieee-cs-tchpc-award-winners/).
