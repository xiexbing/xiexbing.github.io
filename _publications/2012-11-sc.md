Supercomputer I/O loads are often dominated by
writes. HPC (High Performance Computing) file systems are
designed to absorb these bursty outputs at high bandwidth
through massive parallelism. However, the delivered write bandwidth often falls well below the peak. This paper characterizes
the data absorption behavior of a center-wide shared Lustre
parallel file system on the Jaguar supercomputer. We use a
statistical methodology to address the challenges of accurately
measuring a shared machine under production load and to
obtain the distribution of bandwidth across samples of compute
nodes, storage targets, and time intervals. We observe and
quantify limitations from competing traffic, contention on storage
servers and I/O routers, concurrency limitations in the client
compute node operating systems, and the impact of variance
(stragglers) on coupled output such as striping. We then examine
the implications of our results for application performance and
the design of I/O middleware systems on shared supercomputers.
