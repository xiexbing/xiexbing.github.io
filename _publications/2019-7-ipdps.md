We present the design and implementation of Data
Jockey, a data management system for HPC multi-tiered storage systems. As a centralized data management control plane,
Data Jockey automates bulk data movement and placement for
scientific workflows and integrates into existing HPC storage
infrastructures. Data Jockey simplifies data management by eliminating human effort in programming complex data movements,
laying datasets across multiple storage tiers when supporting
complex workflows, which in turn increases the usability of multitiered storage systems emerging in modern HPC data centers.
Specifically, Data Jockey presents a new data management
scheme called “goal driven data management” that can automatically infer low-level bulk data movement plans from declarative
high-level goal statements that come from the lifetime of iterative
runs of scientific workflows. While doing so, Data Jockey aims
to minimize data wait times by taking responsibility for datasets
that are unused or to be used, and aggressively utilizing the
capacity of the upper, higher performant storage tiers.
We evaluated a prototype implementation of Data Jockey
under a synthetic workload based on a year’s worth of Oak Ridge
Leadership Computing Facility’s (OLCF) operational logs. Our
evaluations suggest that Data Jockey leads to higher utilization of
the upper storage tiers while minimizing the programming effort
of data movement compared to human involved, per-domain adhoc data management scripts.
