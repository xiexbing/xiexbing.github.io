In this paper, we develop a predictive model useful for output performance prediction of supercomputer ile systems under production
load. Our target environment is TitanÐthe 3rd fastest supercomputer in the worldÐand its Lustre-based multi-stage write path.
We observe from Titan that although output performance is highly
variable at small time scales, the mean performance is stable and
consistent over typical application run times. Moreover, we ind
that output performance is non-linearly related to its correlated parameters due to interference and saturation on individual stages on
the path. These observations enable us to build a predictive model
of expected write times of output patterns and I/O conigurations,
using feature transformations to capture non-linear relationships.
We identify the candidate features based on the structure of the
Lustre/Titan write path, and use feature transformation functions
to produce a model space with 135,000 candidate models. By searching for the minimal mean square error in this space we identify a
good model and show that it is efective.
